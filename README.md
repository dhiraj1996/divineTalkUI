## UI Library Used and Why  

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** as the primary utility-first CSS framework.  

**Why Tailwind CSS?**  
- **Utility-First Approach:** Tailwind CSS provides utility classes that allow for rapid styling without writing custom CSS.  
- **Customization:** Tailwind CSS offers an easy way to customize the design system (colors, spacing, typography) to match project needs.  
- **Responsive Design:** Built-in responsive utilities make creating layouts that adapt to all devices seamless.  
- **Performance:** Tailwind CSS reduces the need for repetitive CSS code and improves project maintainability.

## Additional Features  

- **Responsive Design:** The UI is fully responsive and works seamlessly across devices of all sizes.  
- **Custom Components:** Created modular, reusable components for consistency and scalability.  
- **Modern Styling:** Implemented clean and modern UI patterns for a visually appealing design.  
- **Fast Performance:** Optimized styling with Tailwind CSS, reducing unnecessary CSS bloat.

## Challenges Faced  

1. **Difficulty in Adding Custom Fonts:** Integrating custom fonts with Tailwind CSS required proper configuration in the `tailwind.config.js` file and ensuring font imports were correctly set up in the project.  

2. **Creating Cards for Laptop Pixel Dimensions:** Designing cards to perfectly fit specific laptop screen resolutions posed a challenge. Tailwind's responsive utilities were extensively used to fine-tune padding, margins, and grid layouts for a seamless appearance.  

3. **Learning Curve:** Initially, understanding and using Tailwind CSS utility classes effectively required practice to maintain clean and readable code.  

4. **Responsive Design:** Ensuring consistent and pixel-perfect designs across various breakpoints required careful adjustments using Tailwind's responsive props.  

5. **Tooling with Vite:** While Vite's performance is exceptional, initial setup and understanding its configuration for React and Tailwind took additional effort.
